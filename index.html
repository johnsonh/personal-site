    <section id="about">
      <h2>üåÄ About Me</h2>
      <p>Since 2019 I‚Äôve been moving around the world, chasing questions more than stability. I‚Äôve been trying to understand what makes relationships work, what gets in the way of love, what home feels like, and how to live in a way that feels honest.</p>
      <p>I don‚Äôt think of myself as a professional so much as a human who‚Äôs trying things out, writing about them, and inviting people along for the ride.</p>

      <h2>üåè Taiwan Roots Residency</h2>
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Join friends for ~6 months in Taipei to reconnect with Taiwanese roots, culture, and family while building meaningful relationships.</p>
      <p>After 5 years on the road, I‚Äôve been craving more roots‚Äîto live somewhere long enough to be dependable, to host others with steadiness, and to be part of something unfolding over time. Returning to Taiwan recently reminded me how much I want to be close enough to offer care, presence, and hospitality to the people I love.</p>
      <p>This residency is a step in that direction‚Äîand an invitation to do it together.</p>
      <p>Hopefully by the end, you‚Äôll come away more connected to your family and to Taiwan as a place. If we‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll also leave more connected to yourself‚Äîalive in your body, deeper in trust and love, and more excited about life.</p>
