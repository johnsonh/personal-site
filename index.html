      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>I write things, cry easily, host relational spaces, and scheme up ways to feel more alive with people. My work lives in the overlap of inner work, relationships, ancestry, place, and play. I'm less of a professional, more of a person. My favorite mode is figuring things out together.</p>

      <h2>Taiwan Roots Residency</h2>
      <p>Join friends for ~6 months in Taipei to reconnect with Taiwanese roots, culture, and family while building meaningful relationships.</p>
      <p>After 5 years on the road, I’ve been craving more roots—to live somewhere long enough to host others with steadiness, offer care, and be part of something that unfolds over time. This residency is a step in that direction—and an invitation to do it together.</p>
      <p>Hopefully by the end, you’ll feel more connected to family, to Taiwan, and to yourself—alive in your body, deeper in trust and love, and more excited about life. We'll explore ancestry, repair family dynamics, eat absurdly good food, and build something heartfelt.</p>
      <p><strong>What:</strong> Shared living / neighborhood pods. Group dinners, relational workshops, temple visits, ancestral connections, personal projects, countryside trips.</p>
      <p><strong>Who:</strong> People with Taiwanese roots (or resonance with the theme of return), emotional awareness, and interest in community + healing. Mandarin helpful but not required.</p>
      <p><strong>When:</strong> 6 months in Taipei, ideally starting before Chinese New Year.</p>
      <p><strong>Looking for:</strong> 2–3 core co-creators (housing scouts, space holders, cheerleaders). Also: guests, mentors, curious humans.</p>
      <p>I don’t have all the logistics yet. I’m looking for the first few “yeses” to shape this together.</p>
