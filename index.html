      <h2>üåÄ About Me</h2>
      <p>Since 2019 I‚Äôve been moving around the world, chasing questions more than stability. I‚Äôve been trying to understand what makes relationships work, what gets in the way of love, what home feels like, and how to live in a way that feels honest.</p>
      <p>I don‚Äôt think of myself as a professional so much as a human who‚Äôs trying things out, writing about them, and inviting people along for the ride.</p>
